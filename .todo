- fix <mat-icon> need internet!

- when user changing route/page there should be sort of loader/spinner. Loading until the page is loaded. Also, check for animation when transporting between pages

- when language changed the dateTimeWeekPipes are not refreshed because transform() called once. Then the language changed :/

- in add-edit-child add custom validator in 'Order between siblings' field instead of just disable it.

- trim all fields in all forms before submitting.

- in add-edit-child component add isArchive field only shown when edit child. Also, in children page show only isArchive=false children, using server or in client depends on you. And there should be an option for showing isArchive=true children, using another page or filter in the children page depends on you.
