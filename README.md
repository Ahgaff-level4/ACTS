# Autism Children Technical System (ACTS)

## Setup

- ### NodeJs

  1. Install NodeJs. Preferred version 18.13.0
  2. Check installation by typing in the CMD:

      ```cmd
      node -v
      ```

      Also

      ```cmd
      npm -v
      ```

      You should get the version number

- ### MySQL

  1. Install MySQL.
  2. Open MySQL Workbench.
  3. Create New Connection.
  4. Test the connection.
  5. Change the host and port in the file `.env` in the `backend-nest` folder to the same port and hostname used by MySQL.

- ### Angular

  1. Pre-condition: installing NodeJs.
  2. Open this project by the CMD. Preferred using VisualCode open the Terminal.
  3. Navigate to `frontend-angular` folder. So, the terminal will look like:

      ```cmd
      .../ACTS/frontend-angular>
      ```

  4. Then type:

      ```cmd
      .../ACTS/frontend-angular> npm install
      ```

      So that all dependencies in `package.json` will be downloaded and installed.
      >See `README.md` file in `frontend-angular` folder for more information of how to run the application.

- ### NestJs

  1. Pre-condition: installing NodeJs.
  2. Open this project by the CMD. Preferred using VisualCode open the Terminal.
  3. Navigate to `backend-nest` folder. So, the terminal will look like:

      ```cmd
      .../ACTS/backend-nest>
      ```

  4. Then type:

      ```cmd
      .../ACTS/backend-nest> npm install
      ```

      So that all dependencies in `package.json` will be downloaded and installed.
      >See `README.md` file in `backend-nest` folder for more information of how to run the application.

## Debug process

- Angular project as frontend. Debug will be in localhost of angular (it is a server but temporary).
- NestJS project as backend. Debug will be in localhost of nestJs (it is another and main server).
- These two projects will be in the same repository; to share common files (e.g., classes).
- To debug Angular with NestJs api we need to run both servers. Then, solve Cross-Origin problem. After that, in Angular we use Nest api by addressing full path (e.g., `localhost:NestPort/api/...` ).
- When finish debugging we will build the Angular project, take resulting files. After that, it will be hosing in NestJs. Then deploy NestJs.

## Convention

- ### **Naming**

  #### **1. No hard coded text string.**

  There should be a way to convert all static text string to Arabic.
  >`var title = R.lang.titleName`

  #### **2. Address path of HTML page should be identical to its most used table name.**

  > field page will have address path as: `domain.com/field`

  #### **3. Address path of JSON API will have prefix of `api` .**

  >`domain.com/api/...`

  #### **4. Address path of JSON API should be identical to its most used table name.**

  >`domain.com/api/field` for all operations: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.

  #### **5. All table names and their columns should be identical in coding BUT in camelCase.**

  > Table `Performance(ID, Name, FieldId)` will be `performance(id, name, fieldId)`

  #### **6. Foreign key name is the refereed table name with suffix of `id`.**

  > `performance(..., fieldId)`

  #### **7. Foreign key attribute have its object with same attribute name subtract `Id`.**

  > `goal(..., performanceId)` Will has `goal(..., performanceId, performance)` where `performance` is object of type Performance, correspond of performanceId. This is true only by retrieving data from the server. And the child attribute `performance` in our example has nothing to do in deleting or updating. Its job only to show the `performanceId` information. We will let the frontend developer solve this issue as a homework ðŸ™‚

  #### **8. Any attribute of type `Date` -in javascript- its name should contains `Date`, or `Datetime` if time is concerned.**

  Because JSON format dose not has type `Date`. But the database has different types for `DATE` and `DATETIME`.
  > `person(..., birthDate, createdDatetime)` Here we can know `birthDate` is type of `Date` -in javascript- and time is NOT concerned. `createdDatetime` is also type of `Date` but time is concerned.

- ### **API**

  #### **1. Each table will have 5 calls base on params and operations:**
  
  - Create, with `POST` operation passing an object as in request body.
    > `http.post("domain.com/api/field", fieldObject)`

  - Update, with `PATCH` operation passing updated object in request body, and the item id in the request param.
    > `http.patch("domain.com/api/field/"+fieldObject.id, fieldObject)`

  - Delete, with `DELETE` operation passing the id of the deleted item in request param.
    > `http.delete("domain.com/api/field/"+fieldObject.id)`

  - Read, with `GET` operation optionally passing id as param if not passed will return all.
    > `http.get("domain.com/api/field")` will return all fields.
    
    > `http.get("domain.com/api/field/1")` will return array of length one -if exist or zero- of the field with `id == 1`

    Tables may have foreign key so to get an object instead only foreign key id. We pass true to `FK` query
    > `http.get("domain.com/api/child?FK=true")` will return all children with `person` property has person object that correspond to `personId`.

  #### **2. GET request of path with table name (e.g., `.../api/field` or `.../api/field/1`) will return an object its properties is exactly its columns. And properties with derived attribute. And foreign key will be as said in (`Convention` > `Naming` > `7`)**

  > Table `goal(id, performanceId, ...)` will has path `.../api/goal` and will respond -for GET operation- with an array of goals object structure as `[{id:1, performanceId:9, performance:{...,minAge:4,maxAge:6}...}, ...]`

  #### **3. Each request should provide a token in the request header. And authorization of user privilege should be in the server before any respond.**

  > `headers:{'Authorization': 'Bearer a876d8a5dd79a79f6f'}`

  #### **4. Properties of type `Date` should send to the server with type string and its value is in ISO format.**

  > we can easily convert variable of type `Date` to string of ISO format by `new Date().toISOString()`
