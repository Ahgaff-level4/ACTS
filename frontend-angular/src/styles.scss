// Plus imports for other components in your app.

// Include the common styles for Angular Material. We include this here so that you only
// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!

@include mat-core();

// import our custom theme
@import "./theme.scss";

// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.
// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component
// that you are using.

@include angular-material-theme($my-theme);

// Include the dark color styles inside of a block with a CSS class. You can make this
// CSS class whatever you want. In this example, any component inside of an element with
// `.dark-theme` will be affected by this alternate dark theme instead of the default theme.

.dark-theme {
  @include angular-material-color($dark-theme);
}

// Override typography for all Angular Material, including mat-base-typography and all components.
@include angular-material-typography($typography);
